                        At [Company Name], we want our customers to be completely satisfied with their food order. If for any reason you need to cancel an order or request a refund, please read the following information carefully.
                        <br /><br />
                        Cancellation Policy:
                        <br /><br />
                        You can cancel your order anytime before the restaurant starts preparing your food. To cancel an order, please contact our customer support team by phone or email, and provide them with your order details. Once we receive your cancellation request, we will process it as soon as possible.
                        <br /><br />
                        Refund Policy:
                        <br /><br />
                        We understand that sometimes things don't go as planned and you may need to request a refund. Here's what you need to know:
                        <br /><br />
                        If you cancel your order before the restaurant starts preparing your food, you will receive a full refund.
                        <br /><br />
                        If you cancel your order after the restaurant has started preparing your food, we may not be able to issue a full refund. In such cases, we will review your request and determine the amount of refund you are eligible for based on the circumstances.
                        <br /><br />
                        If there was an issue with your order, such as wrong item delivered, missing items or poor quality, please contact our customer support team immediately. We will investigate the issue and if we find that it was our fault, we will issue a full refund.
                        <br /><br />
                        If you have any other questions or concerns about our cancellation and refund policy, please don't hesitate to contact our customer support team.
                        <br /><br />
                        We hope you enjoy your food and have a great experience with YumYards. Thank you for choosing us for your food order needs.
