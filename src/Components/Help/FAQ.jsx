          We value our customerâ€™s time and hence moved away from a single customer care number to a comprehensive chat-based support system for quick and easy resolution. You no longer have to go through the maze of an IVRS call support. Just search for your issue in the help section on this page and initiate a chat with us. A customer care executive will be assigned to you shortly. You can also email us your issue on YumYards@gmail.com
          <br /><br />
          Note: We value your privacy and your information is safe with us. Please do not reveal any personal information, bank account number, OTP etc. to another person. A YumYardsrepresentative will never ask you for these details. Please do not reveal these details to fraudsters and imposters claiming to be calling on our behalf. Be vigilant and do not entertain phishing calls or emails.

        <Accordion.Header>Can i edit my order?</Accordion.Header>
        <Accordion.Body>
          Check the Order Status
          <br />
          Before attempting to edit your order, you should first check its status. If the order has already been confirmed by the restaurant, you may not be able to make changes. However, if the order is still being prepared, you can usually make modifications.
          <br /><br />
          Contact Customer Support<br />
          If you are unable to make changes to your order through the app, you can always contact the customer support team of the food ordering application. They will be able to assist you in making any necessary changes to your order.
          <br /><br />
          Be Mindful of Time<br />
          If you need to make changes to your order, it's important to do so as soon as possible. The longer you wait, the more likely it is that the restaurant has already started preparing your food. If this is the case, you may not be able to make changes.
          <br /><br />
          Check for Additional Charges<br />
          Keep in mind that if you make changes to your order, there may be additional charges. For example, if you add extra toppings to your pizza or upgrade your drink, you may be charged more. Be sure to check the updated total before confirming any changes.
          <br /><br />
          In conclusion, most food ordering applications allow you to make changes to your order, but it's important to check the status of your order and be mindful of time. If you need assistance, don't hesitate to contact customer support. By following these guidelines, you can ensure that your food order is exactly what you want it to be.
